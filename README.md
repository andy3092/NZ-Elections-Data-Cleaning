# NZ-Elections-Data-Cleaning
Some scripts to download and clean New Zealand election results data and load them into sqlite.

At the moment only cleans the 2014 election party vote results.

### TODO
Add commandline arguments for the load2sqlite script.

Split off the Maori electrates into a seprate table last 7 files 
for the load2sqlite script.

Need some sanity checks to check that the csv files are being read in correctly.
