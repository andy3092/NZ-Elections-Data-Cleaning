# NZ-Elections-Data-Cleaning
Some scripts to download and clean New Zealand election results data and load them into sqlite.

At the moment downloads and cleans up the 2014 election party vote results.

# TODO
Add some proper commandline arguments for the scrips instead of hardcoding options in. e.g. year you want to download and clean, where you want to save files, output file names etc.
